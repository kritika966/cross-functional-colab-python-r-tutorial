# Cross-Functional Collaboration: Python & R in Google Colab
This repository contains a Google Colab tutorial that demonstrates how cross-functional teams — Python developers and R statisticians — can collaborate effectively in one notebook.

## The tutorial uses the Home Credit Default Risk Dataset to showcase:
- Sharing data between Python and R (%R -i, %R variable)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and visualization
- Handling missing data
